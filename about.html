                    <p>Hey, I'm Lillie! Web Developer & Designer<br><br>
                    I'm originally from a tiny town in New Zealand called Whakatu.
                    I moved to Naarm in 2014 and haven't looked back.
                    I live here with my partner (Samuel), our son (Harlow),
                    and our two fluffy sausage dogs (Puku & Pirate).<br><br>
                    I'm an active relaxer; I relax by doing stuff and keeping my hands busy.
                    I love to knit, draw, cook, lift heavy weights at the gym, read
                    fantasy books, and landscape our backyard. Although, I don't have a green
                    thumb so it's a guessing game which plants decide to stick around.<br><br>
                    Most of my time goes into my knitting business, Chunky Boy. I hand-knit
                    one-off and limited-edition clothing pieces that ship all over the world.
                    It started as a hobby to unwind but organically turned into a business
                    in 2017. Through a lot of google searches, trial and error, and countless
                    YouTube videos. I started teaching myself coding basics. Turns out I
                    really enjoy the tech side of things as much as the creative side.<br><br>
                    Working on my own website, everything just clicked. My brain liked
                    what I was learning. I joined Coder Academy to dig deeper, build on what I've
                    taught myself, learn to code and open new doors for myself in the field of tech.</p>
