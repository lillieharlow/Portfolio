<mark>ALL PAGES</mark>
- Header with nav bar
    - Fixed
    - Center
    - Spaced evenly across top
    - Mobile menu (hamburger) when screen size is small
    - Links to other pages in website

    Header tag didnt use nav because used div to make a container for flex box to allow for screen responsiveness and keep everything aligned center until it is 600px. Then mobile menu activates and menu is in hamburger icon.

    50px for height of nav bar to look chunkier and give text space around top and bottom.

    Colour themes the yellow really stands out against the black. easy to read and not plain like white text. this was done by selecting only link elements in external css sheet.

    hamburger menu icon is widely known and accepted as a navigation icon. clean and simple design. allows for landing page to be simple and not lots of nav content when viewing on mobile. visual trigger to click and explore website content.

    Editied a menu icon from flaticon to allow me to match colour of desktop menu.
